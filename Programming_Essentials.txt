How does a computer program work?
This guide aims to show you what the Python language is and what it is used for.
Let's start from the absolute basics.
A program makes a computer usable.
Without a program, a computer, even the most powerful one, is nothing more than an object.
Similarly, without a player, a piano is nothing more than a wooden box.
Computers are able to perform very complex tasks, but this ability is not innate. 
A computer's nature is quite different.
It can execute only extremely simple operations, e.g., a computer cannot evaluate the value of a complicated 
mathematical function by itself, 
although this isn't beyond the realms of possibility in the near future.
Contemporary computers can only evaluate the results of very fundamental operations,
like adding or dividing,  but they can do it very fast, and can repeat these actions virtually any number of times.
