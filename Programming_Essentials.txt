How does a computer program work?
This guide aims to show you what the Python language is and what it is used for.
Let's start from the absolute basics.
A program makes a computer usable.

Similarly, without a player, a piano is nothing more than a wooden box.
Computers are able to perform very complex tasks, but this ability is not innate. 
A computer's nature is quite different.
