data processing 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Why do we need functions?
You've come across functions many times so far, but the view on their merits that we have given you has 
been rather one-sided. You've only invoked the functions by using them as tools to make life easier, 
and to simplify time-consuming and tedious tasks.
When you want some data to be printed on the console, you use print(). When you want to read the value 
of a variable, you use input(), coupled with either int() or float().
You've also made use of some methods, which are in fact functions, but declared in a very specific way.
Now you'll learn how to write your own functions, and how to use them. We'll write several functions together, 
from the very simple to the rather complex, which will require your focus and attention.
It often happens that a particular piece of code is repeated many times in your program. It's repeated 
either literally, or with only a few minor modifications, consisting of the use of other variables in the 
same algorithm. It also happens that a programmer cannot resist simplifying the work, and begins to clone 
such pieces of code using the clipboard and copy-paste operations.
It could end up as greatly frustrating when suddenly it turns out that there was an error in the cloned code.
The programmer will have a lot of drudgery to find all the places that need corrections. There's also a 
high risk of the corrections causing errors.
We can now define the first condition which can help you decide when to start writing your own functions: 
if a particular fragment of the code begins to appear in more than one place, consider the possibility of 
isolating it in the form of a function invoked from the points where the original code was placed before.
It may happen that the algorithm you're going to implement is so complex that your code begins to grow in 
an uncontrolled manner, and suddenly you notice that you're not able to navigate through it so easily 
anymore.
You can try to cope with the issue by commenting the code extensively, but soon you find that this 
dramatically worsens your situation - too many comments make the code larger and harder to read. Some say 
that a well-written function should be viewed entirely in one glance.
A good and attentive developer divides the code (or more accurately: the problem) into well-isolated pieces, 
and encodes each of them in the form of a function.
This considerably simplifies the work of the program, because each piece of code can be encoded separately, 
and tested separately. The process described here is often called decomposition.
We can now state the second condition: if a piece of code becomes so large that reading and understating it 
may cause a problem, consider dividing it into separate, smaller problems, and implement each of them in 
the form of a separate function.
This decomposition continues until you get a set of short functions, easy to understand and test.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Functions 
Decomposition 
It often happens that the problem is so large and complex that it cannot be assigned to a single developer, 
and a team of developers have to work on it. The problem must be split between several developers in a way 
that ensures their efficient and seamless cooperation.
It seems inconceivable that more than one programmer should write the same piece of code at the same time, 
so the job has to be dispersed among all the team members.
This kind of decomposition has a different purpose to the one described previously - it's not only about 
sharing the work, but also about sharing the responsibility among many developers.
Each of them writes a clearly defined and described set of functions, which when combined into the module 
(we'll tell you about this a bit later) will give the final product.
This leads us directly to the third condition: if you're going to divide the work among multiple 
programmers, decompose the problem to allow the product to be implemented as a set of separately 
written functions packed together in different modules.
Where do the functions come from?
In general, functions come from at least three places:
from Python itself - numerous functions (like print()) are an integral part of Python, and are always 
available without any additional effort on behalf of the programmer; we call these functions built-in 
functions;
from Python's preinstalled modules - a lot of functions, very useful ones, but used significantly less 
often than built-in ones, are available in a number of modules installed together with Python; the use of 
these functions requires some additional steps from the programmer in order to make them fully accessible 
(we'll tell you about this in a while);
directly from your code - you can write your own functions, place them inside your code, and use them freely;
there is one other possibility, but it's connected with classes, so we'll omit it for now.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Your first function
Take a look at the snippet in the editor.
It's rather simple, but we only want it to be an example of transforming a repeating part of a code into a function.
The messages sent to the console by the print() function are always the same. Of course, there's nothing 
really bad in such a code, but try to imagine what you would have to do if your boss asked you to change 
the message to make it more polite, e.g., to start it with the phrase "Please,".
It seems that you'd have to spend some time changing all the occurrences of the message (you'd use a 
clipboard, of course, but it wouldn't make your life much easier). It's obvious that you'd probably make 
some mistakes during the amendment process, and you (and your boss) would get a bit frustrated.
Is it possible to separate such a repeatable part of the code, name it and make it reusable? It would mean that 
a change made once in one place would be propagated to all the places where it's used.
Of course, such a code should work only when it's explicitly launched.
Yes, it's possible. This is exactly what functions are for.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Your first function
How do you make such a function?
You need to define it. The word define is significant here.
This is what the simplest function definition looks like:
def functionName():
    functionBody

It always starts with the keyword def (for define)
next after def goes the name of the function (the rules for naming functions are exactly the same as for naming variables)
after the function name, there's a place for a pair of parentheses (they contain nothing here, but that 
will change soon)
the line has to be ended with a colon;
the line directly after def begins the function body - a couple (at least one) of necessarily nested 
instructions, which will be executed every time the function is invoked; note: the function ends where the 
nesting ends, so you have to be careful.
We're ready to define our prompting function. We'll name it message - here it is:
def message():
    print("Enter a value: ")
The function is extremely simple, but fully usable. We've named it message, but you can label it 
according to your taste. Let's use it.

Our code contains the function definition now:
def message():
    print("Enter a value: ")

print("We start here.")
print("We end here.")
Note: we don't use the function at all - there's no invocation of it inside the code.
When you run it, you see the following output:
We start here.
We end here.
This means that Python reads the function's definitions and remembers them, but 
won't launch any of them without your permission.
We've modified the code now - we've inserted the function's invocation between the start and end messages:
def message():
    print("Enter a value: ")

print("We start here.")
message()
print("We end here.")

The output looks different now:
We start here.
Enter a value: 
We end here.
Test the code, modify it, experiment with it.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
How functions work
when you invoke a function, Python remembers the place where it happened and jumps into the invoked 
function;
the body of the function is then executed;
reaching the end of the function forces Python to return to the place directly after the point of invocation.

You mustn't invoke a function which is not known at the moment of invocation.
Remember - Python reads your code from top to bottom. It's not going to look ahead in order to find a 
function you forgot to put in the right place ("right" means "before invocation".)
We've inserted an error into this code - can you see the difference?
print("We start here.")
message()
print("We end here.")

def message():
    print("Enter a value: ")

We've moved the function to the end of the code. Is Python able to find it when the execution reaches the invocation?
No, it isn't. The error message will read:
NameError: name 'message' is not defined
Don't try to force Python to look for functions you didn't deliver at the right time.
The second catch sounds a little simpler:
You mustn't have a function and a variable of the same name
The following snippet is erroneous:
def message():
    print("Enter a value: ")

message = 1

Assigning a value to the name message causes Python to forget its previous role. The function named message becomes 
unavailable.
Fortunately, you're free to mix your code with functions - you're not obliged to put all your functions at the top of your source file.

Look at the snippet:
print("We start here.")

def message():
    print("Enter a value: ")

message()

print("We end here.")

It may look strange, but it's completely correct, and works as intended.
Let's return to our primary example, and employ the function for the right job, like here:
def message():
    print("Enter a value: ")

message()
a = int(input())
message()
b = int(input())
message()
c = int(input())


Modifying the prompting message is now easy and clear - you can do it by changing the code in just 
one place - inside the function's body.
Open the mycompiler.io, and try to do it yourself.

Key takeaways
1. A function is a block of code that performs a specific task when the function is called (invoked). 
You can use functions to make your code reusable, better organized, and more readable. Functions can have 
parameters and return values.
2. There are at least four basic types of functions in Python:
built-in functions which are an integral part of Python (such as the print() function). You can see a complete 
list of Python built-in functions at https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html.
the ones that come from pre-installed modules (you'll learn about them in Module 5 of this course)
user-defined functions which are written by users for users - you can write your own functions and use them freely in your code,
the lambda functions (you'll learn about them in Module 6 of this course.)
You can define your own function using the def keyword and the following syntax:
def yourFunction(optional parameters):
    # the body of the function

You can define a function which doesn't take any arguments, e.g.:
def message():    # defining a function
    print("Hello")    # body of the function

message()    # calling the function 

You can define a function which takes arguments, too, just like the one-parameter function below:
def hello(name):    # defining a function
    print("Hello,", name)    # body of the function


name = input("Enter your name: ")

hello(name)    # calling the function

We'll tell you more about parametrized functions in the next section. Don't worry.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
How functions communicate with their environment
The function's full power reveals itself when it can be equipped with an interface that is able to accept 
data provided by the invoker. Such data can modify the function's behavior, making it more flexible and 
adaptable to changing conditions.
A parameter is actually a variable, but there are two important factors that make parameters different and special:
parameters exist only inside functions in which they have been defined, and the only place where the parameter 
can be defined is a space between a pair of parentheses in the def statement;
assigning a value to the parameter is done at the time of the function's invocation, by specifying 
the corresponding argument.
def function(parameter):
    ###

Don't forget:
parameters live inside functions (this is their natural environment)
arguments exist outside functions, and are carriers of values passed to corresponding parameters.
There is a clear and unambiguous frontier between these two worlds.
Let's enrich the function above with just one parameter - we're going to use it to show the user the 
number of a value the function asks for.
We have to rebuild the def statement - this is how it looks now:
def message(number):
    ###

The definition specifies that our function operates on just one parameter named number. You can 
use it as an ordinary variable, but only inside the function - it isn't visible anywhere else.
Let's now improve the function's body:
def message(number):
    print("Enter a number:", number)

We've made use of the parameter. Note: we haven't assigned the parameter with any value. Is it correct?
Yes, it is.
A value for the parameter will arrive from the function's environment.
Remember: specifying one or more parameters in a function's definition is also a requirement, and you 
have to fulfil it during invocation. You must provide as many arguments as there are defined parameters.
Failure to do so will cause an error.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Parametrized functions: continued
Try to run the code in the editor.
This is what you'll see in the console:
TypeError: message() missing 1 required positional argument: 'number'
This looks better, for sure:
def message(number):
    print("Enter a number:", number)

message(1)

Moreover, it behaves better. The code will produce the following output:
Enter a number: 1
Can you see how it works? The value of the argument used during invocation (1) has been passed into the 
function, setting the initial value of the parameter named number.

We have to make you sensitive to one important circumstance.
It's legal, and possible, to have a variable named the same as a function's parameter
The snippet illustrates the phenomenon:
def message(number):
    print("Enter a number:", number)

number = 1234
message(1)
print(number)

A situation like this activates a mechanism called shadowing:
parameter x shadows any variable of the same name, but...
... only inside the function defining the parameter.
The parameter named number is a completely different entity from the variable named number.
This means that the snippet above will produce the following output:
Enter a number: 1
1234

code sample:
def message(number):
    print("Enter a number:", number)

message(1)
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Parametrized functions: continued
A function can have as many parameters as you want, but the more parameters you have, the harder it is to 
memorize their roles and purposes.
Let's modify the function - it has two parameters now:
def message(what, number):
    print("Enter", what, "number", number)

This also means that invoking the function will require two arguments.
The first new parameter is intended to carry the name of the desired value.
Here it is:
def message(what, number):
    print("Enter", what, "number", number)

message("telephone", 11)
message("price", 5)
message("number", "number")

This is the output you're about to see:
Enter telephone number 11
Enter price number 5
Enter number number number

Run the code, modify it, add more parameters, and see how this affects the output.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Positional parameter passing
A technique which assigns the ith (first, second, and so on) argument to the ith (first, second, and so on) 
function parameter is called positional parameter passing, while arguments passed in this way are named 
positional arguments.
You've used it already, but Python can offer a lot more. We're going to tell you about it now.
def myFunction(a, b, c):
    print(a, b, c)

myFunction(1, 2, 3)
Note: positional parameter passing is intuitively used by people in many social occasions. For example, 
it may be generally accepted that when we introduce ourselves we mention our first name(s) before our last 
name, e.g., "My name's John Doe."
Incidentally, Hungarians do it in reverse order.
Let's implement that social custom in Python. The following function will be responsible for introducing somebody:
def introduction(firstName, lastName):
    print("Hello, my name is", firstName, lastName)

introduction("Luke", "Skywalker")
introduction("Jesse", "Quick")
introduction("Clark", "Kent")

Can you guess the output? Run the code and find out if you were right.
Now imagine that the same function is being used in Hungary. In this case, the code would look like this:
def introduction(firstName, lastName):
    print("Hello, my name is", firstName, lastName)

introduction("Skywalker", "Luke")
introduction("Quick", "Jesse")
introduction("Kent", "Clark")

The output will look different. Can you guess it?
Run the code to see if you were right here, too. Are you surprised?
Can you make the function more culture-independent?
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Keyword argument passing
Python offers another convention for passing arguments, where the meaning of the argument is dictated by its name, 
not by its position - it's called keyword argument passing.
Take a look at the snippet:
def introduction(firstName, lastName):
    print("Hello, my name is", firstName, lastName)

introduction(firstName = "James", lastName = "Bond")
introduction(lastName = "Skywalker", firstName = "Luke")
The concept is clear - the values passed to the parameters are preceded by the target parameters' names, followed by the = sign.
The position doesn't matter here - each argument's value knows its destination on the basis of the name used.
You should be able to predict the output. Run the code to check if you were right.
Of course, you mustn't use a non-existent parameter name.
The following snippet will cause a runtime error:
def introduction(firstName, lastName):
    print("Hello, my name is", firstName, lastName)

introduction(surname="Skywalker", firstName="Luke")
This is what Python will tell you:
TypeError: introduction() got an unexpected keyword argument 'surname'
Try it yourself!
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Mixing positional and keyword arguments
You can mix both fashions if you want - there is only one unbreakable rule: you have to put positional arguments before keyword arguments.
If you think for a moment, you'll certainly guess why.
To show you how it works, we'll use the following simple three-parameter function:
def adding(a, b, c):
    print(a, "+", b, "+", c, "=", a + b + c)

Its purpose is to evaluate and present the sum of all its arguments.
The function, when invoked in the following way:
adding(1, 2, 3)
will output:
1 + 2 + 3 = 6
It was - as you may suspect - a pure example of positional argument passing.
Of course, you can replace such an invocation with a purely keyword variant, like this:
adding(c = 1, a = 2, b = 3)
Our program will output a line like this:
2 + 3 + 1 = 6
Note the order of the values.
Let's try to mix both styles now.
Look at the function invocation below:
adding(3, c = 1, b = 2)
Let's analyze it:
the argument (3) for the a parameter is passed using the positional way;
the arguments for c and b are specified as keyword ones.
This is what you'll see in the console:
3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Be careful, and beware of mistakes. If you try to pass more than one value to one 
argument, all you'll get is a runtime error.
Look at the invocation below - it seems that we've tried to set a twice:
adding(3, a = 1, b = 2)
Python's response:
TypeError: adding() got multiple values for argument 'a'
Look at the snipet below. A code like this is fully correct, but it doesn't make much sense:
adding(4, 3, c = 2)
Everything is right, but leaving in just one keyword argument looks a bit weird - what do you think?
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Parametrized functions - more details
It happens at times that a particular parameter's values are in use more often than others. Such arguments 
may have their default (predefined) values taken into consideration when their corresponding arguments have 
been omitted.
They say that the most popular English last name is Smith. Let's try to take this into account.
The default parameter's value is set using clear and pictorial syntax:
def introduction(firstName, lastName="Smith"):
    print("Hello, my name is", fistName, lastName)

You only have to extend the parameter's name with the = sign, followed by the default value.
Let's invoke the function as usual:
introduction("James", "Doe")
Can you guess the output of the program? Run it and check if you were right.
And? Everything looks the same, but when you invoke the function in a way that looks a bit suspicious at 
first sight, like this:
introduction("Henry")
or this:
introduction(firstName="William")
there will be no error, and both invocations will succeed, while the console will show the following output:
Hello, my name is Henry Smith
Hello, my name is William Smith
Test it.
You can go further if it's useful. Both parameters have their default values now, look at the code below:
def introduction(firstName="John", lastName="Smith"):
    print("Hello, my name is", firstName, lastName)

This makes the following invocation absolutely valid:
introduction()
And this is the expected output:

Hello, my name is John Smith
If you use one keyword argument, the remaining one will take the default value:
introduction(lastName="Hopkins")
The output is:
Hello, my name is John Hopkins
Test it.
Congratulations - you have just learned the basic ways of communicating with functions.
def introduction(firstName, lastName="Smith"):
    print("Hello, my name is", firstName, lastName)

# call the function here

introduction("Michael")

Section summery 
Key takeaways
1. You can pass information to functions by using parameters. Your functions can have as many parameters as you need
An example of a one-parameter function:
def hi(name):
    print("Hi,", name)

hi("Giga"

An example of a two-parameter function:
def hiAll(name1, name2):
    print("Hi,", name2)
    print("Hi,", name1)

hiAll("Sebastian", "Konrad")

An example of a three-parameter function:
def address(street, city, postalCode):
    print("Your address is:", street, "St.,", city, postalCode)

s = input("Street: ")
pC = input("Postal Code: ")
c = input("City: ")

address(s, c, pC)

2. You can pass arguments to a function using the following techniques:
positional argument passing in which the order of arguments passed matters (Ex. 1),
keyword (named) argument passing in which the order of arguments passed doesn't matter (Ex. 2),
a mix of positional and keyword argument passing (Ex. 3).
Ex. 1
def subtra(a, b):
    print(a - b)

subtra(5, 2)    # outputs: 3
subtra(2, 5)    # outputs: -3


Ex. 2
def subtra(a, b):
    print(a - b)

subtra(a=5, b=2)    # outputs: 3
subtra(b=2, a=5)    # outputs: 3

Ex. 3
def subtra(a, b):
    print(a - b)

subtra(5, b=2)    # outputs: 3
subtra(5, 2)    # outputs: 3

It's important to remember that 
positional arguments mustn't follow keyword arguments. That's why if you try to run the following snippet:
def subtra(a, b):
    print(a - b)

subtra(5, b=2)    # outputs: 3
subtra(a=5, 2)    # Syntax Error

Python will not let you do it by signalling a SyntaxError

exercise with output:

What is the output of the following snippet?

def intro(a="James Bond", b="Bond"):
    print("My name is", b + ".", a + ".")

intro()

My name is Bond. James Bond.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Effects and results: the return instruction
All the previously presented functions have some kind of effect - they produce some text and send it to the console.
Of course, functions - like their mathematical siblings - may have results.
To get functions to return a value (but not only for this purpose) you use the return instruction.
This word gives you a full picture of its capabilities. Note: it's a Python keyword.
The return instruction has two different variants - let's consider them separately.
return without an expression
The first consists of the keyword itself, without anything following it.
When used inside a function, it causes the immediate termination of the function's execution, and an 
instant return (hence the name) to the point of invocation.

Note: if a function is not intended to produce a result, using the return instruction is not obligatory 
- it will be executed implicitly at the end of the function.
Anyway, you can use it to terminate a function's activities on demand, before the control reaches the 
function's last line.

Let's consider the following function:
def happy_new_year(wishes = True):
    print("Three...")
    print("Two...")
    print("One...")
    if not wishes:
        return
    
    print("Happy New Year!")

When invoked without any arguments:
happy_new_year()
The function causes a little noise - the output will look like this:
Three...
Two...
One...
Happy New Year!

Providing False as an argument:
happy_new_year(False)
will modify the function's behavior - the return instruction 
will cause its termination just before the wishes - this is the updated output:
Three...
Two...
One...

return with an expression
The second return variant is extended with an expression:

def function():
    return expression

There are two consequences of using it:
it causes the immediate termination of the function's execution (nothing new compared to the first variant)
moreover, the function will evaluate the expression's value and will return (hence the name once again) 
it as the function's result.

Yes, we already know - this example isn't really sophisticated:
def boring_function():
    return 123

x = boring_function()

print("The boring_function has returned its result. It's:", x)

The snippet writes the following text to the console:
The boring_function has returned its result. It's: 123
Let's investigate it for a while.

The return instruction, enriched with the expression (the expression is very simple here), "transports" the 
expression's value to the place where the function has been invoked.
The result may be freely used here, e.g., to be assigned to a variable.
It may also be completely ignored and lost without a trace.
Note, we're not being too polite here - the function returns a value, and we ignore it (we don't use it in any way):
def boring_function():
    print("'Boredom Mode' ON.")
    return 123

print("This lesson is interesting!)
boring_function()
print("This lesson is boring...")

The program produces the following output:
This lesson is interesting!
'Boredom Mode' ON.
This lesson is boring...

Is it punishable? Not at all.
The only disadvantage is that the result has been irretrievably lost.
Don't forget:
you are always allowed to ignore the function's result, and be 
satisfied with the function's effect (if the function has any)
if a function is intended to return a useful result, it must contain the second variant of the return instruction.

Wait a minute - does this mean that there are useless results, too? Yes - in some sense.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A few words about None
Let us introduce you to a very curious value (to be honest, a none value) named None.
Its data doesn't represent any reasonable value - actually, it's not a value at all; hence, it mustn't 
take part in any expressions.
For example, a snippet like this:
print(None + 2)
will cause a runtime error, described by the following diagnostic message:
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'
Note: None is a keyword.
There are only two kinds of circumstances when None can be safely used:
when you assign it to a variable (or return it as a function's result)
when you compare it with a variable to diagnose its internal state.
Just like here:

value = None
if value is None:
   print("Sorry, you don't carry any value")

Don't forget this: if a function doesn't return a certain value using a return expression clause, 
it is assumed that it implicitly returns None.

Let's test it.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A few words about None: continued
Take a look at the code in the editor.
It's obvious that the strangeFunction function returns True when its argument is even.
What does it return otherwise?
We can use the following code to check it:
print(strangeFunction(2))
print(strangeFunction(1))
This is what we see in the console:
True
None

Don't be surprised next time you see None as a function result - it may be the 
symptom of a subtle mistake inside the function.
def strangeFunction(n):
    if(n % 2 == 0):
        return True
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Effects and results: lists and functions
There are two additional questions that should be answered here.
The first is: may a list be sent to a function as an argument?
Of course it may! Any entity recognizable by Python can play the role of a function argument, although it 
has to be assured that the function is able to cope with it.
So, if you pass a list to a function, the function has to handle it like a list.
A function like this one here:
def list_sum(lst):
    s = 0
    
    for elem in lst:
        s += elem
    
    return s
and invoked like this:
print(list_sum([5, 4, 3]))
will return 12 as a result, but you should expect problems if you invoke it in this risky way:
print(list_sum(5))
Python's response will be unequivocal:
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
This is caused by the fact that a single integer value mustn't be iterated through by the for loop.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Effects and results: lists and functions - continued
The second question is: may a list be a function result?
Yes, of course! Any entity recognizable by Python can be a function result.
Look at the code in the editor. The program's output will be like this:
[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
Now you can write functions with and without results.
Let's dive a little deeper into the issues connected with variables in functions. This is 
essential for creating effective and safe functions.

LAB: A leap year: writing your own functions
Estimated time
10-15 minutes
Level of difficulty
easy
Objectives
Familiarize the student with:
projecting and writing parameterized functions;
utilizing the return statement;
testing the functions.

Scenario
Your task is to write and test a function which takes one argument (a year) and returns True if the year 
is a leap year, or False otherwise.

The seed of the function is already sown in the skeleton code in the editor.
Note: we've also prepared a short testing code, which you can use to test your function.
The code uses two lists - one with the test data, and the other containing the expected results. 
The code will tell you if any of your results are invalid.

def isYearLeap(year):
#
# put your code here
#

testData = [1900, 2000, 2016, 1987]
testResults = [False, True, True, False]
for i in range(len(testData)):
	yr = testData[i]
	print(yr,"->",end="")
	result = isYearLeap(yr)
	if result == testResults[i]:
		print("OK")
	else:
		print("Failed")

LAB: How many days: writing and using your own functions
Estimated time
15-20 minutes
Level of difficulty
Medium
Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

projecting and writing parameterized functions;
utilizing the return statement;
utilizing the student's own functions.

Scenario
Your task is to write and test a function which takes two arguments (a year and a month) and returns 
the number of days for the given month/year pair (while only February is sensitive to the year value, 
your function should be universal).

The initial part of the function is ready. Now, convince the function to return None if its arguments 
don't make sense.

Of course, you can (and should) use the previously written and tested function (LAB 4.1.3.6). 
It may be very helpful. We encourage you to use a list filled with the months' lengths. You can create it 
inside the function - this trick will significantly shorten the code.

We've prepared a testing code. Expand it to include more test cases.
def isYearLeap(year):
#
# your code from LAB 4.1.3.6
#

def daysInMonth(year, month):
#
# put your new code here
#

testYears = [1900, 2000, 2016, 1987]
testMonths = [2, 2, 1, 11]
testResults = [28, 29, 31, 30]
for i in range(len(testYears)):
	yr = testYears[i]
	mo = testMonths[i]
	print(yr, mo, "->", end="")
	result = daysInMonth(yr, mo)
	if result == testResults[i]:
		print("OK")
	else:
		print("Failed")

Converting fuel consumption
Scenario 
A car's fuel consumption may be expressed in many different ways. For example, in Europe, it is shown as 
the amount of fuel consumed per 100 kilometers.
In the USA, it is shown as the number of miles traveled by a car using one gallon of fuel.
Your task is to write a pair of functions converting l/100km into mpg, and vice versa.
The functions:
are named l100kmtompg and mpgtol100km respectively;
take one argument (the value corresponding to their names)
Complete the code in the editor.
Run your code and check whether your output is the same as ours.
Here is some information to help you:
1 American mile = 1609.344 metres;
1 American gallon = 3.785411784 litres.
Test Data
Expected output:
60.31143162393162
31.36194444444444
23.52145833333333
3.9007393587617467
7.490910297239916
10.009131205673757
----------------------------------------------
def l100kmtompg(litros):
    galones = litros / 3.785411784
    millas = 100 * 1000 / 1609.344
    return millas / galones
    
def mpgtol100km(millas):
    km100 = millas * 1609.344 / 1000 / 100
    litros = 3.785411784
    return litros / km100


print(l100kmtompg(3.9))
print(l100kmtompg(7.5))
print(l100kmtompg(10.))
print(mpgtol100km(60.3))
print(mpgtol100km(31.4))
print(mpgtol100km(23.5))

Key takeaways 

1. You can use the return keyword to tell a function to return some value. 
The return statement exits the function, e.g.:
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

print(multiply(3, 4))    # outputs: 12

def multiply(a, b):
    return

print(multiply(3, 4))    # outputs: None

2. The result of a function can be easily assigned to a variable, e.g.:
def wishes():
    return "Happy Birthday!"

w = wishes()

print(w)    # outputs: Happy Birthday!

Look at the difference in output in the following two examples:

# Example 1
def wishes():
    print("My Wishes")
    return "Happy Birthday"

wishes()    # outputs: My Wishes


# Example 2
def wishes():
    print("My Wishes")
    return "Happy Birthday"

print(wishes())    # outputs: My Wishes
                   #          Happy Birthday


3. You can use a list as a function's argument, e.g.:

def hiEverybody(myList):
    for name in myList:
        print("Hi,", name)

hiEverybody(["Adam", "John", "Lucy"])


4. A list can be a function result, too, e.g.:

def createList(n):
    myList = []
    for i in range(n):
        myList.append(i)
    return myList

print(createList(5))
